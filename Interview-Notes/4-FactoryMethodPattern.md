The factory method pattern

The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Dependency Inversion Principle
Depend upon abstractions; do not depend on concrete classes.
